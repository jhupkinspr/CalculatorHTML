Excited to share my first projectâ€”a basic calculator built with HTML! ðŸ’»ðŸ§®

As part of my ongoing journey to deepen my skills in web development, I decided to create a simple calculator using HTML. While it may seem like a basic project, it allowed me to practice fundamental concepts such as HTML structure, forms, and basic JavaScript for functionality.

The calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also includes a clear button to reset the input for a new calculation.

Building this calculator was a fun and educational experience, helping me reinforce my understanding of HTML and JavaScript. I welcome any feedback or bug reports to further improve the project!
